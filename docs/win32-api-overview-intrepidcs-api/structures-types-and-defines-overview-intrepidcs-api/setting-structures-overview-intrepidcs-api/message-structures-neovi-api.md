# Message Structures - neoVI API

These structures are used to represent messages both received and transmitted by the neoVI device. These structures can also be represented as an [array of bytes described in a separate topic](using-an-array-instead-of-a-message-structure-intrepidcs-api).

**Remarks**

There are two structures here. Both are equivalent. The only difference is how they represent message bytes. The icsspyMessageJ1850 provides a more convenient representation for J1850 or ISO messages with a header array holding the first three bytes of the message.

These structures can be use interchangeably in C by casting one type to the other. In Visual Basic, you can copy one structure to the other using the LSet method.

Table 1 below lists the members of the structure and specific remarks about there use.

| Item                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| StatusBitField StatusBitField2 StatusBitField3 StatusBitField4 | Bitfields which describe the message. These are described in a [separate topic](status-bitfields-neovi-api).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| TimeHardware TimeHardware2                                     | This is the hardware time stamp. The function [GetTimeStampForMsg](../../message-functions-overview-intrepidcs-api/gettimestampformsg-method-intrepidcs-api) will convert these to seconds. If the hardware has an RTC (Real Time Clock), T-0 is Jan 1, 2007. Other devices start when the unit is powered or connected to by open function.                                                             |
| TimeSystem TimeSystem2                                         | This is the system time stamp. TimeSystem is loaded with the value received from the timeGetTime call in the WIN32 multimedia API. The timeGetTime accuracy is up to 1 millisecond. See the WIN32 API documentation for more information. This timestamp is useful for time comparing with other system events or data which is not synced with the neoVI timestamp. Currently, TimeSystem2 is not used. |
| TimeStampHardwareID                                            | This is an identifier of what type of hardware timestamp is used. Since neoVI’s timestamp is always the same, this doesn’t change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| TimeStampSystemID                                              | This is an identifier of what type of system timestamp is used. Since WIN32 neoVI’s timestamp is always the same, from the timeGetTime API, this doesn’t change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| NetworkID NetworkID2                                           | This is the NetworkID as assigned in the OpenPort method. This value is used to identify which network this message was received on. The topic here [NetworkIDList](neovi-network-id-list) contains the ID mapping NetworkID2 is a continuation. NetworkID + (NetworkID2 \* 100) can be used to join this into one value.                                                                                |

| Protocol                                                       | This is the type of protocol which the message belongs to. Valid values are SPY\_PROTOCOL\_CAN, SPY\_PROTOCOL\_CANFD, and SPY\_PROTOCOL\_ISO9141.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| MessagePieceID                                                 | Not Used in the neoVI API.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
